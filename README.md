# dog-api
Technical test for dog API

# Task
Use a simple API which returns breeds of dog and images as a JSON array. Use HTML, CSS and Javascript to read the API and display it in an organized way. In addition, it should contain some sort of sorting mechanic to the front-end. Freedom to use any frameworks/taskrunners/compilers to achieve this task.

# Approch
Using any library for this task seemed a bit overkill for a simple task. I deicded to got with an image gallery with essecially buttons which are actually just list items. Looking back I would probablly change this to buttons than list items to make them more accessible. The gallery will load with random images as I didnt want the page to be empty on load. this gallery will either show 15 random dogs on load or upto 15 of a selected breed.
